## What is it?
Parky Layers is a Blender extension allowing you to create 2D keyframed animations. Think Alight Motion, but in Blender. This extension is heavily inspired by the workflow that the adult animated TV show South Park uses for animation (which is also where it's namesake comes from!).

## Why do we need this?
Not many reasons to. It's an experimental project at best, so I wouldn't recommend using it for production work. But, for personal work, I highly recommend it! It's cool and fun to work with.

## How does it work?
Layers are created as mesh planes with a flat shader and an empty texture. A list on your sidebar allows you to change layer Z-indexing and add/remove layers. After you draw your image, you can then animate it using Blender's default keyframing tools, and render using Workbench or EEVEE.
